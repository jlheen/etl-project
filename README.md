# etl-project
Project for Jade &amp; Jodi for Extracting, Transforming, &amp; Loading data.

We chose a public dataset from Kaggle with a large amount of books, all collected from the Goodreads API. We combined the isbn numbers from this dataset with the Open Library API to see which books would have a url on Open Library. These two datasets were loaded into a Postgres database.
