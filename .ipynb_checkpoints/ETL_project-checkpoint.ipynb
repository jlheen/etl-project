    "#### Loading \n",
    "The final step is to load our two data tables into a Postgres relational database. Both of the datasets we extracted and transformed were very structured. They were also chosen based on a primary key - their shared isbn index. The data was also ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) compliant. Therefore, we chose SQL as our database. We loaded the data using Postgres by creating tables, indexed on the primary key, and then imported the data from our two csv files."

    "## Final Notes\n",
    "The most difficult part of the project was finding datasets that would be useful. The Goodreads csv was a great place to start, but then finding something that we could pair it with proved challenging. Scraping Amazon or another bookseller website would be ideal, since it would include the isbn number and another value of interest: book price. Automating that process and running it through a loop would be fairly tedious and challenging, however, especially since the process would need to begin again from the home page for each book. An API was a good option, but we were unable to find a reliable API that showed pricing info. The Open Library API was easy to use and still provided another source of information on top of the original csv. If someone were to search the dataset by an isbn number, they could locate the book, the information from goodreads, and likely access it in the Open Library website. From there, there is seller information and more for getting access to the text itself.\n",
    "### Potential Analysis\n",
    "Some potential analysis would be to test:  \n",
    "- how many authors there are total in the database and how many books each author has \n",
    "- how many books have an Open Library url vs. how many do not\n",
    "- the average rating of books with an Open Library url vs. the average rating of the books without an url\n",
    "- the number of books attributed to an author with an Open Library url vs. the average rating of the books attributed to an author who does not have an Open Library url"
